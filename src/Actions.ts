 *
 * Add easy-peasy actions for undo and redo. (Also add actions for reset and save, though these
 * aren't typically needed by users.)
 *
 * Store a stack of undo/current/redo states. These are stored as json
 * strings in the browser's localStorage key value store.
 *
 * Middleware to automatically trigger the save action after other
 * easy-peasy or redux actions.
 *
 * Note that computed properties and view properties specified by the programmer are not
 * saved. Computed and view properties are merged into the current app state
 * on undo/redo.
